# Website Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify websites as either legitimate or phishing (fraudulent) based on various features extracted from the URLs and website content. The goal is to help users identify potentially harmful websites and protect themselves from online threats.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about different websites, including features like URL length, presence of special characters, and whether the website uses HTTPS. Each website is labeled as either legitimate or phishing.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**: We collected data from various sources and compiled it into a dataset stored in an Excel file.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We cleaned and prepared the data for analysis. This involved handling missing values, standardizing numerical data, and converting text data into a format suitable for machine learning.

3. **Feature Selection**: We identified the most important features that help in distinguishing between legitimate and phishing websites.

4. **Model Training**: We used different machine learning algorithms to train models that can classify websites based on the selected features.

5. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluated the performance of the trained models to ensure they accurately classify websites.

## Results

The models were able to classify websites with a high degree of accuracy. This means they can effectively distinguish between legitimate and phishing websites based on the features extracted from the URLs and website content.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to enhance online security by identifying potentially harmful websites. The trained models can be integrated into web browsers or security software to provide real-time protection to users.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application**: Use the provided scripts to run the application and classify websites.
2. **Input Website Data**: Provide the URL or other relevant information about the website you want to classify.
3. **Get Classification**: The application will analyze the input data and classify the website as either legitimate or phishing.

By using this project, users can enhance their online safety and avoid falling victim to phishing attacks.
